    # It's unclear to me whether or not there actually is three different versions, or if Microsoft just has an
    # identity crisis when they have to version different products in the same suite of tools.
    # https://github.com/actions/runner-images/blob/main/images/windows/Windows2025-Readme.md#microsoft-visual-c 
    # suggests the latter. In either case, MSVC++ 2022 appears to be too old to build anything, which may or may
    # not be why the compiler shits itself with a billion errors in nghttp2 (of all places to crash; nghttp2 is
    # plain C)
    # This will likely not run until github actions bumps the MSVC version. There's some third party tools that
    # may or may not be used to bump the image, but they're not widely used and I don't feel like it
