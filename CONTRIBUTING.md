# Contribution guidelines

This file is mostly aimed at developers, and primarily describes the setup required for development, and project-specific things to think about when contributing code. For general open-source contribution guidelines, see [opensource.guide](//opensource.guide). The guidelines listed under "Basic guidelines" do apply to all forms of contributions, including issues.

This file will not go into detail on how to write issues. Any important details that need to be included (if any) will be part of an issue template, selectable when you create an issue. If none exists for your use-case (or at all), use common sense. I do strongly suggest reading [the section on communicating effectively on opensource.guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#communicating-effectively) if you're wondering how to write good issues. There's nothing anyone could write here that isn't covered there and in thousands of other resources around the internet in far greater detail.

## Basic guidelines

### Use of generative AI is banned

Generative AI uses training data [based on plagiarism and piracy](https://web.archive.org/web/20250000000000*/https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/03/libgen-meta-openai/682093/), has [significant environmental costs associated with it](https://doi.org/10.21428/e4baedd9.9070dfe7), and [generates fundamentally insecure code](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10664-024-10590-1). GenAI is not ethically built, ethical to use, nor safe to use for programming applications. When caught, you will be permanently banned from contributing to the project, and any prior contributions will be checked and potentially reverted. Any and all contributions you've made cannot be trusted if AI slop machines were involved.
